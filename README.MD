This is a standard Tic Tac Toe game. 



GAMEPLAY

The player plays against computer. Who goes first is determined at random before 
each game. Computer always plays "X" and the player plays "O". Statistics of 
all wins, loses and ties is displayed on the screen. To exit the game either 
press "Escape" key or close the window.



AI

To make computer play intelligently, during the initial launch of the game a 
tree of all possible game moves is built. Then the computer uses minimax 
algorithm to traverse this tree and find the best possible move (or moves) at 
the given state of the game. This makes beating computer pretty impossible.
